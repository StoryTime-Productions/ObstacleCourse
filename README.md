## Description

ObstacleRush is a simple 3D game developed using the Unity Engine. It is a project that is developed by the team to learn the basics around using a game engine and discovering the proper steps to implement games from bare assets to a fully-working game.

- Rotating, dropping and rolling obstacles that must be avoided.
- An always-following camera that tracks the main player's position.

The game is solely meant for learning purposes and is not planned to be released to major platforms, unless significant and unique features are implemented.

## How to Play

- Dodge the rotating, falling, and rolling obstacles in the hopes of obtaining a perfect score.
- Restart the game as many times as desired to improve your previous score.
